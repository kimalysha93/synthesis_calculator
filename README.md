# Metaphor: ReFantazio Synthesis Calculation

This personal project is a simple online tool to be used when playing _Metaphor: ReFantazio_. It was inspired by the online fusions calculators that others have created for the _Persona_ and _SMT_ games. Lineage and Archetype can be selected by the user, and the results will display a list of all the active Synthesis skills for the selected party composition.

 _Metaphor: Refantazio_ is lacking a menu area where it's possible to view all active synthesis skills on one screen. While playing I found planning party compositions in-game was often tedious or repetetive due to my short memory and the necessary backtracking I often needed to do, so I created this small project to not assist with that, but also practice my JavaScript, HTML, and css skills.
